# What is Sous?

Sous is a tool for building, testing, and deploying software
into DCOS systems, specifically Mesos.

Sous consists of three major components:

- **Sous Engine** (a library) provides the main functionality of Sous.
- **Sous Server** provides functionality and data using Sous Core.
- **Sous CLI** provides the same tools as Sous Server, on the command line, as
  well as additional tools for local development.

All of these components are data-driven,
and do not make any assumptions about organisation-specific factors.
To use sous, you need to provide configuration describing
your organisation's infrastructure, applications, and policies:

- **Infrastructure Configuration** describes your organisation's datacentres
 and environments.
- **Application Configuration** describes your organisation's applications.
- **Policy Configration** describes, in code, your organisation's policies about
  what can and cannot be deployed where. This uses the concept of "contracts"
  which are automated integration tests you expect deployable artefacts to pass
  before they can be deployed.
- **Sous Buildpacks** provide standardised build pipelines for your applications.

Using this configuration,
Sous allows users to create deployments of applications to infrastructure.
This organisation-wide data structure is called "Sous State".
Sous State is a version-controlled artefact
declaring all of your organisation's deployed applications,
and their version, and their environmental configuration.
Sous State is generated by Sous Engine based on events.

Sous State contains the following information:

- **Global Deployment Manifest** (GDM)
  is the main data structure, containing the entire global deployment state.
- **GDM History**
  is the entire history of all previous GDMs, allowing reflection and auditing of changes.
