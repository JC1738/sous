# Change log

The scope of semantic versioning as it applies to this project is not yet fully defined. By the release of v1.0.0 we hope to be able to semantically version the
CLI, the server, and the main Sous library.

## v1.0.0-alpha.2

Fixes an issue with the build process only.

## v1.0.0-alpha.1

This alpha release is a tech demo of a narrow cross-section of the final v1 release. It allows users to:

- Build a correctly tagged and labelled Docker images using Dockerfiles.
- Push the built image to the configured Docker registry.
- Deploy the built image via the sous rectify command.
