Todo in messaging:

DLQ something something...
  Very easy to neglect the OTL field, which would silently drop log messages.
Related: easy to fail to implement a logging interface and not get the data you wanted.
Tests per message - check against a golden master, test GMs against checker.
(how to confirm test per message?)

testing for metrics
  delivered to graphite
  reported on /debug/metrics
OTLs - write & PR
Add messages instead of logging.
errors - model on pkg/errors
  OTL?
resettable timers (cyclic? noncyclic?)
  "observables", run just before each graphite delivery
  timers "observe" the the time since they were reset into a sample

removing legacy interfaces

log every recover
log every early goroutine exit
(debug) log every goroutine exit (and metrics for "now I'm done")
