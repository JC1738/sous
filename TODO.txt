Todo in messaging:

DLQ something something...
  Very easy to neglect the OTL field, which would silently drop log messages.
  Could implement MetricsOn or Console, but not report a metric/write
    (partly covered now with Done()s on those - need a "schtum" call,
    and then to check "used")
Tests per message - check against a golden master, test GMs against checker.
(how to confirm test per message?)
So: test helpers for logging.

testing for metrics
  delivered to graphite
  reported on /debug/metrics

OTLs - write & PR

Add messages instead of logging.

errors - model on pkg/errors
  OTL?

resettable timers (cyclic? noncyclic?)
  "observables", run just before each graphite delivery
  timers "observe" the the time since they were reset into a sample

removing legacy interfaces

log every recover
log every early goroutine exit
(debug) log every goroutine exit (and metrics for "now I'm done")
