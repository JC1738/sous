If you need to manipulate the Git repos in this test environment, here are clues about how to do it:

First,
`docker run  -p 2222:22 testregistry_gitserver:latest`
(or `docker-compose up`)


Then:
`repo-reset.sh [IP of docker host (if not localhost)]`

Reverts any unintentional changes to the docker repos.

`git -c core.sshcommand=$(pwd)/ssh_wrapper clone ssh://root@127.0.0.1:2222/repos/sous-server /tmp/sous-server`
The sshcommand is important, for reasons too tedious to recount.

Use the `git -c core.sshcommand` formula for `push` as well.

Finally:
`repo-snapshot.sh [IP again]`
